# A history of unix

## The old age
1937 - 1950, The computer was built to serve specific research or engineering purpose, like US Army. 
1950 - 1960, more and more computers were built for research & commerical purpose, to surve the purpose, computers were mainly doing batch process jobs, like [http://www.computerhistory.org/timeline/1953/#169ebbe2ad45559efbc6eb357208a518](IBM's 701 Electronic Data Processing) and IBM has procuded various machines and they were called [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainframe_computer](mainframe)
1960, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation](DEC) invented [http://www.computerhistory.org/pdp-1/the-machine/](PDP-1) as first mini-computer

The systems were designed to do time-sharing like [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incompatible_Timesharing_System](ITS), and written in assemly language, so the system can not be ported to different hardware.

## The early age
1964, [http://web.mit.edu/multics-history/](MIT multics) was started to build an operating system for [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GE-600_series](GE 645), multics intended to be a felxible operating system and provide an interactive programming environment, but it failed, which was pulled out by Bell labs later, enginner [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson](Ken Thompson) and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie](Dennis M. Ritchie) worked in Bell Labs and worked on multics and create a game called [https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/spacetravel.html](Space Travel) based on it. 
In 1969, multics was dead, and Ken and Dennis love the model of multics, but could not find an alternative, while they were rewriting the space travel on [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-7](PDP-7), they built [https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/hist.html](an early version of Unix including File system, process control and IO redirection) and also [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_(programming_language)](B Programming Language, which can do the cross-compier)
In 1971, PDP-7 started to reach its limitations, Bell Labs bought a new PDP-11 and Ken started to port the early version of unix, but the system were written mostly in B programming language are word-oriented, so it is not easy to port to byte-oriented PDP-11, so [https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/chist.html](C Programming Language) was invented, and UNIX was all written in C. Since C can support cross-platform compile.
