# A history of unix

## The old age
1937 - 1950, The computer was built to serve specific research or engineering purpose, like US Army. 
1950 - 1960, more and more computers were built for research & commerical purpose, to surve the purpose, computers were mainly doing batch process jobs, like [IBM's 701 Electronic Data Processing](http://www.computerhistory.org/timeline/1953/#169ebbe2ad45559efbc6eb357208a518) and IBM has procuded various machines and they were called [mainframe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainframe_computer)
1960, [DEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation) invented [PDP-1](http://www.computerhistory.org/pdp-1/the-machine/) as first mini-computer

The systems were designed to do time-sharing like [ITS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incompatible_Timesharing_System), and written in assemly language, so the system can not be ported to different hardware.

## The early age
1964, [MIT multics](http://web.mit.edu/multics-history/) was started to build an operating system for [GE 645](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GE-600_series), jointly by MIT, GE and Bell Labs, multics intended to be a felxible operating system and provide an interactive programming environment, but it failed, enginner [Ken Thompson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson) worked in Bell Labs and worked on multics and create a game called [Space Travel](https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/spacetravel.html) based on it. 

In 1969, multics was dead, and Ken and engineeris love the model of multics, but could not find an alternative, while they were rewriting the space travel on [PDP-7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-7), they built [an early version of Unix including File system, process control and IO redirection](https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/hist.html) and also [B Programming Language, which can support cross-platform compile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_(programming_language)).

In 1971, PDP-7 started to reach its limitations, Bell Labs bought a new PDP-11 and Ken started to port the early version of unix, but the system were written mostly in B programming language are word-oriented, so it is not easy to port to byte-oriented PDP-11, so [C Programming Language](https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/chist.html) was invented, and UNIX was all written in C. 

Since C can support cross-platform compile, so the first operating system which can run on different hardware was invented and soon become popular.

## The morden age
